# Parallel Programming in C#
## Overview
This repository provides an in-depth exploration of .NET Parallel Programming with C#. It delves into the core multithreading facilities in the .NET Framework, specifically focusing on the Task Parallel Library (TPL) and Parallel LINQ (PLINQ).

## Prerequisites
- A basic understanding of C# and the .NET framework.
- Familiarity with multithreading concepts.

## Topics Included
- Task Programming
  - Learn how to create, execute, cancel, and manage tasks, as well as handle exceptions that arise during task execution.
- Data Sharing and Synchronization
  - Ensure safe and consistent access to shared data across multiple threads.
- Concurrent Collections
  - Utilize thread-safe collections like ConcurrentBag for effective multi-threaded operations.
- Task Coordination
  - Understand continuations and the use of synchronization primitives to coordinate tasks.
- Parallel Loops
  - Implement parallel loops to efficiently iterate over counters or collections, partitioning data for processing across multiple threads.
- Parallel LINQ (PLINQ)
  - Leverage the parallel version of Language-Integrated Query (LINQ) for improved data processing performance.
- Async/Await
  - Explore .NET's asynchronous programming support to write non-blocking, scalable code.

## Target Audience
This repository is designed for:

- Beginner and experienced .NET/C# developers seeking to enhance their knowledge of parallel programming.
- Computer Science students interested in modern multithreading and parallelism techniques.
- Individuals keen on understanding and implementing asynchronous programming and parallel processing.

## Usage
Since all examples are consolidated in this repository and the files are in .txt format, you can easily convert them back to the original .cs files by simply removing the .txt extension. This allows you to run and modify the code directly in your preferred C# development environment. To make the most of the materials in this repository, ensure you meet the outlined requirements.
